#  Library Management System

A full-stack **Library Management System** built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **React.js**. This application allows users to sign up, log in, and manage books depending on their role (admin or normal user). It features secure authentication, role-based access control, pagination, and search functionality.

##  Features

###  User Authentication

* Secure sign-up and login system.
* Passwords hashed using **bcrypt**.
* Session management using **JWT tokens**.

###  Admin Privileges

* Add, update, and delete books.
* Manage the entire book catalog.

###  Normal User Privileges

* View all available books.
* Search books by title, author, or description.
* Paginated book display.

###  UI & UX (React.js)

* Modern and responsive design built with React.
* Search and pagination on the client side.
* Token-based requests for secure communication.

---

##  Tech Stack

### Backend

* **Node.js**
* **Express.js**
* **MongoDB** with Mongoose
* **bcrypt** for password hashing
* **jsonwebtoken (JWT)** for authentication
* **dotenv** for environment variables

### Frontend

##  Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-management-system.git
cd library-management-system
```

### 2️⃣ Setup Backend

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file inside the backend folder and add:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/library
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
```

Then run the backend:

```bash
npm start
```

### 3️⃣ Setup Frontend

```bash
cd Client
npm install
npm start
```

Ensure the backend API is running on **[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)**.

##  Security

* Passwords are hashed before being stored.
* Tokens are used to secure endpoints.
* Admin-only routes are protected via middleware.
* Basic CORS protection enabled.

>  For production, use **httpOnly cookies** instead of localStorage for tokens to improve security.
